This folder contains modelled data for environmental layers such as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), pH, salinity, sea surface temperature (SST) and current velocities (UVEL) in .tif files.
Environmental layers are separated by climate scenario (RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5) and time-period (2005-2015, 2040-2050, 2070-2080). Data for these layers were averaged across time period.

Data were collected as outputs from the Parallel Ocean Program (POP) Ocean Model as part of the Community Earth System Model (CESM1) Large Ensemble Project.
